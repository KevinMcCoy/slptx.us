<h2>Services Provided:</h2>

<h3>Evaluation:</h3>
<p>	An initial assessment of the client's speech/language skills is completed. The initial assessment 
	may include a parent interview, standardized 
	assessments, an informal conversational sample, 
	and/or an informal oral-motor examination; checking 
	the muscles needed for articulation. The results of 
	the assessment are given, and recommendations are 
	made. The parents and speech-language pathologist 
	develop a plan to assist the child in achieving his/her 
	speech/language goals. A current speech/language 
	evaluation can be used if completed within the last 
	year.
</p>

<p>Private sessions are available at flexible times. 
	Each treatment session is one 45 minutes long. The 
	frequency of treatment is discussed and based on 
	the initial evaluation results. Clients and parents are

<span>SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THERAPY IS AVAILABLE 
	FOR CHILDREN/ADULTS EXPERIENCING 
	DIFFICULTY IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS:
</span>


<h3>ARTICULATION DISORDER/DELAY:</h3>
<p>	Is when an speech sound is produced incorrectly. 
	This makes it difficult to be understood and can hinder 
	learning to read.
</p>


<h3>LANGUAGE DISORDER/DELAY:</h3>
<p>	Receptive language refers to the ability to understand 
	what is being said. You are receiving the information. 
	Expressive language refers to the ability to say what 
	you are thinking. You are expressing what you are 
	thinking.
</p>


<h3>FLUENCY/STUTTERING:</h3>
<p>	Occurs when sounds, syllables, or words are 
	repeated or prolonged. This causes an interference in 
	the normal flow of speech, which makes it difficult for 
	the listener to concentrate on what is being said.
</p>


<h3>PHONOLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT:</h3>
<p>	Involves incorrect speech patterns. Typically, these 
	errors could include leaving the final consonant 
	off most words: "ha for hat," or "cu for cup." Or 
	substituting consonant 
	sounds that are made in the front of the mouth such 
	as "t" and "d" for sounds that are made in the back 
	of the mouth such as "g" and "k". So the client might 
	say "dood for good" or "tate for cake."
</p>

<h3>ORAL-MOTOR EXERCISES:</h3>
<p>	Refers to the strength and coordination of the oral/
	facial muscles needed for correct speech. The client may 
	exhibit drooling, chewing on clothes, or breathing 
	through their mouth.
